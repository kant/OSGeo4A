OSGeo4A
==========

This provides a set of scripts to build opensource geo tools for android. 

This is *Experimental*

Dependencies instructions
-------------------------
- you need a JDK v6 or later (OpenJDK is also good)
- [Apache ant](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) v1.8 or later
- [Qt5 for android >= 5.9] Install ARMv7 arch support
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads) just command line tools, API 15
- Android NDK (Crystax NDK 10.3.2)

Also read the [upstream Qt information on building Qt5 code for Android](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/androidgs.html).

Build instructions
-----------
Create a file `config.conf` in the root folder by copying the `config.conf.default`
file and edit it accordingly to your needs.

The build system is maintained for QGIS 3.x releases. To build QGIS 2.x releases, modify `recipes/qgis/recipe.sh`
accordingly. Alternatively you may want to clone qgis/QGIS locally and point the `config.conf` file to your local 
repository.

```sh
cd OSGeo4A 
cp config.conf.default config.conf
# nano config.conf
./distribute.sh -dqgis -mqgis
```
